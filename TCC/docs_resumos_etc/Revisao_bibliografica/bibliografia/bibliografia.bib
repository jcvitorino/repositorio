%Role of DREB transcription factors in abiotic and biotic stress tolerance in plants

    abstract = {{Abiotic and biotic stresses negatively influence survival, biomass production and crop yield. Being multigenic as well as a quantitative trait, it is a challenge to understand the molecular basis of abiotic stress tolerance and to manipulate it as compared to biotic stresses. Lately, some transcription factor(s) that regulate the expression of several genes related to stress have been discovered. One such class of the transcription factors is DREB/CBF that binds to drought responsive cis-acting elements. DREBs belong to ERF family of transcription factors consisting of two subclasses, i.e. DREB1/CBF and DREB2 that are induced by cold and dehydration, respectively. The DREBs are apparently involved in biotic stress signaling pathway. It has been possible to engineer stress tolerance in transgenic plants by manipulating the expression of DREBs. This opens an excellent opportunity to develop stress tolerant crops in future. This review intends to focus on the structure, role of DREBs in plant stress signaling and the present status of their deployment in developing stress tolerant transgenic plants.}},

%Classifying transcription factor targets and discovering relevant biological features
%%%
@article{Holloway2008,
    abstract = {{BACKGROUND:An important goal in post-genomic research is discovering the network of interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and the genes they regulate. We have previously reported the development of a supervised-learning approach to TF target identification, and used it to predict targets of 104 transcription factors in yeast. We now include a new sequence conservation measure, expand our predictions to include 59 new TFs, introduce a web-server, and implement an improved ranking method to reveal the biological features contributing to regulation. The classifiers combine 8 genomic datasets covering a broad range of measurements including sequence conservation, sequence overrepresentation, gene expression, and DNA structural properties.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:(1) Application of the method yields an amplification of information about yeast regulators. The ratio of total targets to previously known targets is greater than 2 for 11 TFs, with several having larger gains: Ash1(4), Ino2(2.6), Yaf1(2.4), and Yap6(2.4).(2) Many predicted targets for TFs match well with the known biology of their regulators. As a case study we discuss the regulator Swi6, presenting evidence that it may be important in the DNA damage response, and that the previously uncharacterized gene YMR279C plays a role in DNA damage response and perhaps in cell-cycle progression.(3) A procedure based on recursive-feature-elimination is able to uncover from the large initial data sets those features that best distinguish targets for any TF, providing clues relevant to its biology. An analysis of Swi6 suggests a possible role in lipid metabolism, and more specifically in metabolism of ceramide, a bioactive lipid currently being investigated for anti-cancer properties.(4) An analysis of global network properties highlights the transcriptional network hubs; the factors which control the most genes and the genes which are bound by the largest set of regulators. Cell-cycle and growth related regulators dominate the former; genes involved in carbon metabolism and energy generation dominate the latter.CONCLUSION:Postprocessing of regulatory-classifier results can provide high quality predictions, and feature ranking strategies can deliver insight into the regulatory functions of TFs. Predictions are available at an online web-server, including the full transcriptional network, which can be analyzed using VisAnt network analysis suite.REVIEWERS:This article was reviewed by Igor Jouline, Todd Mockler(nominated by Valerian Dolja), and Sandor Pongor.}},

%In silico regulatory analysis for exploring human disease progression
%%%%
@article{Holloway2008-2,
    abstract = {{BACKGROUND:An important goal in bioinformatics is to unravel the network of transcription factors (TFs) and their targets. This is important in the human genome, where many TFs are involved in disease progression. Here, classification methods are applied to identify new targets for 152 transcriptional regulators using publicly-available targets as training examples. Three types of sequence information are used: composition, conservation, and overrepresentation.RESULTS:Starting with 8817 TF-target interactions we predict an additional 9333 targets for 152 TFs. Randomized classifiers make few predictions (\~{}2/18660) indicating that our predictions for many TFs are significantly enriched for true targets. An enrichment score is calculated and used to filter new predictions.Two case-studies for the TFs OCT4 and WT1 illustrate the usefulness of our predictions: * Many predicted OCT4 targets fall into the Wnt-pathway. This is consistent with known biology as OCT4 is developmentally related and Wnt pathway plays a role in early development. * Beginning with 15 known targets, 354 predictions are made for WT1. WT1 has a role in formation of Wilms' tumor. Chromosomal regions previously implicated in Wilms' tumor by cytological evidence are statistically enriched in predicted WT1 targets. These findings may shed light on Wilms' tumor progression, suggesting that the tumor progresses either by loss of WT1 or by loss of regions harbouring its targets. * Targets of WT1 are statistically enriched for cancer related functions including metastasis and apoptosis. Among new targets are BAX and PDE4B, which may help mediate the established anti-apoptotic effects of WT1. * Of the thirteen TFs found which co-regulate genes with WT1 (p [less than or equal to] 0.02), 8 have been previously implicated in cancer. The regulatory-network for WT1 targets in genomic regions relevant to Wilms' tumor is provided.CONCLUSION:We have assembled a set of features for the targets of human TFs and used them to develop classifiers for the determination of new regulatory targets. Many predicted targets are consistent with the known biology of their regulators, and new targets for the Wilms' tumor regulator, WT1, are proposed. We speculate that Wilms' tumor development is mediated by chromosomal rearrangements in the location of WT1 targets.REVIEWERS:This article was reviewed by Trey Ideker, Vladimir A.

    abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:Cis-regulatory modules ({CRMs}) are short stretches of {DNA} that help regulate gene expression in higher eukaryotes. They have been found up to 1 megabase away from the genes they regulate and can be located upstream, downstream, and even within their target genes. Due to the difficulty of finding {CRMs} using biological and computational techniques, even well-studied regulatory systems may contain {CRMs} that have not yet been {discovered.RESULTS}:We present a simple, efficient method ({HexDiff}) based only on hexamer frequencies of known {CRMs} and {non-CRM} sequence to predict novel {CRMs} in regulatory systems. On a data set of 16 gap and pair-rule genes containing 52 known {CRMs}, predictions made by {HexDiff} had a higher correlation with the known {CRMs} than several existing {CRM} prediction algorithms: Ahab, Cluster Buster, {MSCAN}, {MCAST}, and {LWF}. After combining the results of the different algorithms, 10 putative {CRMs} were identified and are strong candidates for future study.

%Prediction of regulatory networks: genome-wide identification of transcription factor targets from gene expression data
%%%

@article{Qian2003,
    abstract = {Motivation: Defining regulatory networks, linking transcription factors ({TFs}) to their targets, is a central problem in post-genomic biology. One might imagine one could readily determine these networks through inspection of gene expression data. However, the relationship between the expression timecourse of a transcription factor and its target is not obvious (e.g. simple correlation over the timecourse), and current analysis methods, such as hierarchical clustering, have not been very successful in deciphering {them.Results}: Here we introduce an approach based on support vector machines ({SVMs}) to predict the targets of a transcription factor by identifying subtle relationships between their expression profiles. In particular, we used {SVMs} to predict the regulatory targets for 36 transcription factors in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome based on the microarray expression data from many different physiological conditions. We trained and tested our {SVM} on a data set constructed to include a significant number of both positive and negative examples, directly addressing data imbalance issues. This was non-trivial given that most of the known experimental information is only for positives. Overall, we found that 63\% of our {TF}–target relationships were confirmed through cross-validation. We further assessed the performance of our regulatory network identifications by comparing them with the results from two recent genome-wide {ChIP}-chip experiments. Overall, we find the agreement between our results and these experiments is comparable to the agreement (albeit low) between the two experiments. We find that this network has a delocalized structure with respect to chromosomal positioning, with a given transcription factor having targets spread fairly uniformly across the {genome.Availability}: The overall network of the relationships is available on the web at http://bioinfo.mbb.yale.edu/expression/echipchip},

%Network motif-based identification of transcription factor-target gene relationships by integrating multi-source biological data

<<<<<<< .mine
@article{Zhang2008,
    abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:Integrating data from multiple global assays and curated databases is essential to understand the spatio-temporal interactions within cells. Different experiments measure cellular processes at various widths and depths, while databases contain biological information based on established facts or published data. Integrating these complementary datasets helps infer a mutually consistent transcriptional regulatory network ({TRN}) with strong similarity to the structure of the underlying genetic regulatory modules. Decomposing the {TRN} into a small set of recurring regulatory patterns, called network motifs ({NM}), facilitates the inference. Identifying {NMs} defined by specific transcription factors ({TF}) establishes the framework structure of a {TRN} and allows the inference of {TF}-target gene relationship. This paper introduces a computational framework for utilizing data from multiple sources to infer {TF}-target gene relationships on the basis of {NMs}. The data include time course gene expression profiles, genome-wide location analysis data, binding sequence data, and gene ontology ({GO}) {information.RESULTS}:The proposed computational framework was tested using gene expression data associated with cell cycle progression in yeast. Among 800 cell cycle related genes, 85 were identified as candidate {TFs} and classified into four previously defined {NMs}. The {NMs} for a subset of {TFs} are obtained from literature. Support vector machine ({SVM}) classifiers were used to estimate {NMs} for the remaining {TFs}. The potential downstream target genes for the {TFs} were clustered into 34 biologically significant groups. The relationships between {TFs} and potential target gene clusters were examined by training recurrent neural networks whose topologies mimic the {NMs} to which the {TFs} are classified. The identified relationships between {TFs} and gene clusters were evaluated using the following biological validation and statistical analyses: (1) Gene set enrichment analysis ({GSEA}) to evaluate the clustering results; (2) Leave-one-out cross-validation ({LOOCV}) to ensure that the {SVM} classifiers assign {TFs} to {NM} categories with high confidence; (3) Binding site enrichment analysis ({BSEA}) to determine enrichment of the gene clusters for the cognate binding sites of their predicted {TFs}; (4) Comparison with previously reported results in the literatures to confirm the inferred {regulations.CONCLUSION}:The major contribution of this study is the development of a computational framework to assist the inference of {TRN} by integrating heterogeneous data from multiple sources and by decomposing a {TRN} into {NM}-based modules. The inference capability of the proposed framework is verified statistically (e.g., {LOOCV}) and biologically (e.g., {GSEA}, {BSEA}, and literature validation). The proposed framework is useful for inferring small {NM}-based modules of {TF}-target gene relationships that can serve as a basis for generating new testable hypotheses.},

%Pol {II} promoter prediction using characteristic 4-mer motifs: a machine learning approach
%%%


@article{Anwar2008,
    abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:Eukaryotic promoter prediction using computational analysis techniques is one of the most difficult jobs in computational genomics that is essential for constructing and understanding genetic regulatory networks. The increased availability of sequence data for various eukaryotic organisms in recent years has necessitated for better tools and techniques for the prediction and analysis of promoters in eukaryotic sequences. Many promoter prediction methods and tools have been developed to date but they have yet to provide acceptable predictive performance. One obvious criteria to improve on current methods is to devise a better system for selecting appropriate features of promoters that distinguish them from non-promoters. Secondly improved performance can be achieved by enhancing the predictive ability of the machine learning algorithms {used.RESULTS}:In this paper, a novel approach is presented in which 128 4-mer motifs in conjunction with a non-linear machine-learning algorithm utilising a Support Vector Machine ({SVM}) are used to distinguish between promoter and non-promoter {DNA} sequences. By applying this approach to plant, Drosophila, human, mouse and rat sequences, the classification model has showed 7-fold cross-validation percentage accuracies of 83.81\%, 94.82\%, 91.25\%, 90.77\% and 82.35\% respectively. The high sensitivity and specificity value of 0.86 and 0.90 for plant; 0.96 and 0.92 for Drosophila; 0.88 and 0.92 for human; 0.78 and 0.84 for mouse and 0.82 and 0.80 for rat demonstrate that this technique is less prone to false positive results and exhibits better performance than many other tools. Moreover, this model successfully identifies location of promoter using {TATA} weight {matrix.CONCLUSION}:The high sensitivity and specificity indicate that 4-mer frequencies in conjunction with supervised machine-learning methods can be beneficial in the identification of {RNA} pol {II} promoters comparative to other methods. This approach can be extended to identify promoters in sequences for other eukaryotic genomes.},

%Characterization of the \&lt;i\&gt;TaAIDFa\&lt;/i\&gt; gene encoding a CRT/DRE-binding factor responsive to drought, high-salt, and cold stress in wheat
%%%


@article{Xu2008,
    abstract = {{Dehydration responsive element-binding factors (DBFs) belong to the AP2/ERF superfamily and play vital regulatory roles in abiotic stress responses in plants. In this study, we isolated three novel homologs of the DBF gene family in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) by screening a drought-induced cDNA library and designated them as TaAIDFs (T. aestivum abiotic stress-induced DBFs). Compared to TaAIDFb and TaAIDFc, TaAIDFa lacks a short Ser/Thr-rich region, a putative phosphorylation site, following the AP2/ERF domain. The TaAIDFa gene, located on chromosome 3BS, is interrupted by a single intron at the 17th Arg (R) in the N-terminal domain. The N-terminal region of the TaAIDFa protein modulates nuclear localization. The TaAIDFa protein is capable of binding to CRT/DRE elements in vitro and in vivo, and of trans-activating reporter gene expression in yeast cells. The TaAIDFa promoter, with various stress-related cis-acting elements, drives expression of the GUS reporter gene in wheat calli under stress conditions. This was further confirmed by responses of TaAIDFa transcripts to drought, salinity, low-temperature, and exogenous ABA. Furthermore, overexpression of TaAIDFa activated CRT/DRE-containing genes under normal growth conditions, and improved drought and osmotic stress tolerances in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. These results suggested that TaAIDFa encodes a CRT/DRE element-binding factor that might be involved in multiple abiotic stress signal transduction pathways.}},

@article{Wang2009,
    abstract = {Identification of downstream target genes of stress-relating transcription factors ({TFs}) is desirable in understanding cellular responses to various environmental stimuli. However, this has long been a difficult work for both experimental and computational practices. In this research, we presented a novel computational strategy which combined the analysis of the transcription factor binding site ({TFBS}) contexts and machine learning approach. Using this strategy, we conducted a genome-wide investigation into novel direct target genes of dehydration responsive element binding proteins ({DREBs}), the members of {AP2}-{EREBPs} transcription factor super family which is reported to be responsive to various abiotic stresses in Arabidopsis. The genome-wide searching yielded in total 474 target gene candidates. With reference to the microarray data for abiotic stresses-inducible gene expression profile, 268 target gene candidates out of the total 474 genes predicted, were induced during the 24-h exposure to abiotic stresses. This takes about 57\% of total predicted targets. Furthermore, {GO} annotations revealed that these target genes are likely involved in protein amino acid phosphorylation, protein binding and Endomembrane sorting system. The results suggested that the predicted target gene candidates were adequate to meet the essential biological principle of stress-resistance in plants.},

%{KIRMES}: kernel-based identification of regulatory modules in euchromatic sequences

@article{Schultheiss2009,
    abstract = {Motivation: Understanding transcriptional regulation is one of the main challenges in computational biology. An important problem is the identification of transcription factor ({TF}) binding sites in promoter regions of potential {TF} target genes. It is typically approached by position weight matrix-based motif identification algorithms using Gibbs sampling, or heuristics to extend seed oligos. Such algorithms succeed in identifying single, relatively well-conserved binding sites, but tend to fail when it comes to the identification of combinations of several degenerate binding sites, as those often found in cis-regulatory {modules.Results}: We propose a new algorithm that combines the benefits of existing motif finding with the ones of support vector machines ({SVMs}) to find degenerate motifs in order to improve the modeling of regulatory modules. In experiments on microarray data from Arabidopsis thaliana, we were able to show that the newly developed strategy significantly improves the recognition of {TF} {targets.Availability}: The python source code (open source-licensed under {GPL}), the data for the experiments and a Galaxy-based web service are available at {http://www.fml.mpg.de/raetsch/suppl/kirmes/Contact}: {sebi@tuebingen.mpg.deSupplementary} information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

@article{Hirayama2010,
    abstract = {{Understanding abiotic stress responses in plants is an important and challenging topic in plant research. Physiological and molecular biological analyses have allowed us to draw a picture of abiotic stress responses in various plants, and determination of the Arabidopsis genome sequence has had a great impact on this research field. The availability of the complete genome sequence has facilitated access to essential information for all genes, e.g. gene products and their function, transcript levels, putative cis-regulatory elements, and alternative splicing patterns. These data have been obtained from comprehensive transcriptome analyses and studies using full-length cDNA collections and T-DNA- or transposon-tagged mutant lines, which were also enhanced by genome sequence information. Moreover, studies on novel regulatory mechanisms involving use of small RNA molecules, chromatin modulation and genomic DNA modification have enabled us to recognize that plants have evolved complicated and sophisticated systems in response to complex abiotic stresses. Integrated data obtained with various 'omics' approaches have provided a more comprehensive picture of abiotic stress responses. In addition, research on stress responses in various plant species other than Arabidopsis has increased our knowledge regarding the mechanisms of plant stress tolerance in nature. Based on this progress, improvements in crop stress tolerance have been attempted by means of gene transfer and marker-assisted breeding. In this review, we summarize recent progress in abiotic stress studies, especially in the post-genomic era, and offer new perspectives on research directions for the next decade.}},

The reconstruction of a network is modeled as a binary classification problem for each pair of genes. A statistical classifier is trained to recognize the relationships between the activation profiles of gene pairs. This approach has been proven to outperform previous unsupervised methods. However, the supervised approach raises open questions. In particular, although known regulatory connections can safely be assumed to be positive training examples, obtaining negative examples is not straightforward, because definite knowledge is typically not available that a given pair of genes do not {interact.RESULTS}:A recent advance in research on data mining is a method capable of learning a classifier from only positive and unlabeled examples, that does not need labeled negative examples. Applied to the reconstruction of gene regulatory networks, we show that this method significantly outperforms the current state of the art of machine learning methods. We assess the new method using both simulated and experimental data, and obtain major performance {improvement.CONCLUSIONS}:Compared to unsupervised methods for gene network inference, supervised methods are potentially more accurate, but for training they need a complete set of known regulatory connections. A supervised method that can be trained using only positive and unlabeled data, as presented in this paper, is especially beneficial for the task of inferring gene regulatory networks, because only an incomplete set of known regulatory connections is available in public databases such as {RegulonDB}, {TRRD}, {KEGG}, Transfac, and {IPA}.},

In this paper we investigate the issues that arise when searching for promoters in other species using an ensemble of {SVM} classifiers trained on E. coli promoters. {DNA} sequences are represented using a tagged mismatch string kernel. The major benefit of our approach is that it does not require a prior definition of the typical −35 and −10 hexamers. This gives the {SVM} classifiers the freedom to discover other features relevant to the prediction of promoters. We use our approach to predict σ A promoters in B. subtilis and σ 66 promoters in Chlamydia trachomatis . We extended the analysis to identify specific regulatory features of gene sets in C. trachomatis having different expression profiles. We found a strong −35 hexamer and {TGN}/−10 associated with a set of early expressed genes. Our analysis highlights the advantage of using {TSS}-{PREDICT} as a starting point for predicting promoters in species where few are known.},

%Kernel based methods for accelerated failure time model with ultra-high dimensional data

@article{Liu2010,
    abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:Most genomic data have ultra-high dimensions with more than 10,000 genes (probes). Regularization methods with L1 and Lp penalty have been extensively studied in survival analysis with high-dimensional genomic data. However, when the sample size n << m (the number of genes), directly identifying a small subset of genes from ultra-high (m > 10, 000) dimensional data is time-consuming and not computationally efficient. In current microarray analysis, what people really do is select a couple of thousands (or hundreds) of genes using univariate analysis or statistical tests, and then apply the {LASSO}-type penalty to further reduce the number of disease associated genes. This two-step procedure may introduce bias and inaccuracy and lead us to miss biologically important {genes.RESULTS}:The accelerated failure time ({AFT}) model is a linear regression model and a useful alternative to the Cox model for survival analysis. In this paper, we propose a nonlinear kernel based {AFT} model and an efficient variable selection method with adaptive kernel ridge regression. Our proposed variable selection method is based on the kernel matrix and dual problem with a much smaller n x n matrix. It is very efficient when the number of unknown variables (genes) is much larger than the number of samples. Moreover, the primal variables are explicitly updated and the sparsity in the solution is {exploited.CONCLUSIONS}:Our proposed methods can simultaneously identify survival associated prognostic factors and predict survival outcomes with ultra-high dimensional genomic data. We have demonstrated the performance of our methods with both simulation and real data. The proposed method performs superbly with limited computational studies.},

Transcriptomics, metabolomics, bioinformatics, and high-through-put DNA sequencing have enabled active analyses of regulatory networks that control abiotic stress responses. Such analyses have markedly increased our understanding of global plant systems in responses and adaptation to stress conditions.}},

@article{Das2007,
    abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Unraveling the mechanisms that regulate gene expression is a major challenge in biology. An important task in this challenge is to identify regulatory elements, especially the binding sites in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) for transcription factors. These binding sites are short DNA segments that are called motifs. Recent advances in genome sequence availability and in high-throughput gene expression analysis technologies have allowed for the development of computational methods for motif finding. As a result, a large number of motif finding algorithms have been implemented and applied to various motif models over the past decade. This survey reviews the latest developments in DNA motif finding algorithms.RESULTS:Earlier algorithms use promoter sequences of coregulated genes from single genome and search for statistically overrepresented motifs. Recent algorithms are designed to use phylogenetic footprinting or orthologous sequences and also an integrated approach where promoter sequences of coregulated genes and phylogenetic footprinting are used. All the algorithms studied have been reported to correctly detect the motifs that have been previously detected by laboratory experimental approaches, and some algorithms were able to find novel motifs. However, most of these motif finding algorithms have been shown to work successfully in yeast and other lower organisms, but perform significantly worse in higher organisms.CONCLUSION:Despite considerable efforts to date, DNA motif finding remains a complex challenge for biologists and computer scientists. Researchers have taken many different approaches in developing motif discovery tools and the progress made in this area of research is very encouraging. Performance comparison of different motif finding tools and identification of the best tools have proven to be a difficult task because tools are designed based on algorithms and motif models that are diverse and complex and our incomplete understanding of the biology of regulatory mechanism does not always provide adequate evaluation of underlying algorithms over motif models.}},

%Extracting regulatory sites from the upstream region of yeast genes by computational analysis of oligonucleotide frequencies1

@article{Helden1998,
    abstract = {{We present here a simple and fast method allowing the isolation of DNA binding sites for transcription factors from families of coregulated genes, with results illustrated in Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Although conceptually simple, the algorithm proved efficient for extracting, from most of the yeast regulatory families analyzed, the upstream regulatory sequences which had been previously found by experimental analysis. Furthermore, putative new regulatory sites are predicted within upstream regions of several regulons. The method is based on the detection of over-represented oligonucleotides. A specificity of this approach is to define the statistical significance of a site based on tables of oligonucleotide frequencies observed in all non-coding sequences from the yeast genome. In contrast with heuristic methods, this oligonucleotide analysis is rigorous and exhaustive. Its range of detection is however limited to relatively simple patterns: short motifs with a highly conserved core. These features seem to be shared by a good number of regulatory sites in yeast. This, and similar methods, should be increasingly required to identify unknown regulatory elements within the numerous new coregulated families resulting from measurements of gene expression levels at the genomic scale.

%Finding composite regulatory patterns in DNA sequences

@article{Eskin2002,
    abstract = {{Pattern discovery in unaligned DNA sequences is a fundamental problem in computational biology with important applications in finding regulatory signals. Current approaches to pattern discovery focus on monad patterns that correspond to relatively short contiguous strings. However, many of the actual regulatory signals are composite patterns that are groups of monad patterns that occur near each other. A difficulty in discovering composite patterns is that one or both of the component monad patterns in the group may be 'too weak'. Since the traditional monad-based motif finding algorithms usually output one (or a few) high scoring patterns, they often fail to find composite regulatory signals consisting of weak monad parts. In this paper, we present a MITRA (MIsmatch TRee Algorithm) approach for discovering composite signals. We demonstrate that MITRA performs well for both monad and composite patterns by presenting experiments over biological and synthetic data.}},

A crucial barrier to deciphering these sequences and understanding the relations among them is the difficulty of detecting subtle local residue patterns common to multiple sequences. Such patterns frequently reflect similar molecular structures and biological properties. A mathematical definition of this "local multiple alignment" problem suitable for full computer automation has been used to develop a new and sensitive algorithm, based on the statistical method of iterative sampling. This algorithm finds an optimized local alignment model for N sequences in N-linear time, requiring only seconds on current workstations, and allows the simultaneous detection and optimization of multiple patterns and pattern repeats. The method is illustrated as applied to helix-turn-helix proteins, lipocalins, and prenyltransferases.}},

Galactose-response data yielded the known binding site of Gal4, and six of nine genes known to be induced by galactose. Heat shock data yielded the cell-cycle activation motif, which is known to mediate cell-cycle dependent activation, and a set of genes coding for all four nucleosomal proteins.

%A Gibbs Sampling Method to Detect Overrepresented Motifs in the Upstream Regions of Coexpressed Genes
%%%%%


@article{Thijs2002,
    abstract = {{Microarray experiments can reveal important information about transcriptional regulation. In our case, we look for potential promoter regulatory elements in the upstream region of coexpressed genes. Here we present two modifications of the original Gibbs sampling algorithm for motif finding (Lawrence et al., 1993). First, we introduce the use of a probability distribution to estimate the number of copies of the motif in a sequence. Second, we describe the technical aspects of the incorporation of a higher-order background model whose application we discussed in Thijs et al. (2001). Our implementation is referred to as the Motif Sampler. We successfully validate our algorithm on several data sets. First, we show results for three sets of upstream sequences containing known motifs: 1) the G-box light-response element in plants, 2) elements involved in methionine response in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and 3) the FNR O(2)-responsive element in bacteria. We use these data sets to explain the influence of the parameters on the performance of our algorithm. Second, we show results for upstream sequences from four clusters of coexpressed genes identified in a microarray experiment on wounding in Arabidopsis thaliana. Several motifs could be matched to regulatory elements from plant defence pathways in our database of plant cis-acting regulatory elements (PlantCARE). Some other strong motifs do not have corresponding motifs in PlantCARE but are promising candidates for further analysis.}},

%Identifying the conserved network of cis-regulatory sites of a eukaryotic genome

@article{Wang2005,
    abstract = {{A major focus of genome research has been to decipher the cis-regulatory code that governs complex transcriptional regulation. We report a computational approach for identifying conserved regulatory motifs of an organism directly from whole genome sequences of several related species without reliance on additional information. We first construct phylogenetic profiles for each promoter, then use a blast-like algorithm to efficiently search through the entire profile space of all of the promoters in the genome to identify conserved motifs and the promoters that contain them. Statistical significance is estimated by modified Karlin–Altschul statistics. We applied this approach to the analysis of 3,524 Saccharomyces cerevisiae promoters and identified a highly organized regulatory network involving 3,315 promoters and 296 motifs. This network includes nearly all of the currently known motifs and covers >90\% of known transcription factor binding sites. Most of the predicted coregulated gene clusters in the network have additional supporting evidence. Theoretical analysis suggests that our algorithm should be applicable to much larger genomes, such as the human genome, without reaching its statistical limitation.}},

%PhyloScan: identification of transcription factor binding sites using cross-species evidence

@article{Carmack2007,
    abstract = {{BACKGROUND:When transcription factor binding sites are known for a particular transcription factor, it is possible to construct a motif model that can be used to scan sequences for additional sites. However, few statistically significant sites are revealed when a transcription factor binding site motif model is used to scan a genome-scale database.METHODS:We have developed a scanning algorithm, PhyloScan, which combines evidence from matching sites found in orthologous data from several related species with evidence from multiple sites within an intergenic region, to better detect regulons. The orthologous sequence data may be multiply aligned, unaligned, or a combination of aligned and unaligned. In aligned data, PhyloScan statistically accounts for the phylogenetic dependence of the species contributing data to the alignment and, in unaligned data, the evidence for sites is combined assuming phylogenetic independence of the species. The statistical significance of the gene predictions is calculated directly, without employing training sets.RESULTS:In a test of our methodology on synthetic data modeled on seven Enterobacteriales, four Vibrionales, and three Pasteurellales species, PhyloScan produces better sensitivity and specificity than MONKEY, an advanced scanning approach that also searches a genome for transcription factor binding sites using phylogenetic information. The application of the algorithm to real sequence data from seven Enterobacteriales species identifies novel Crp and PurR transcription factor binding sites, thus providing several new potential sites for these transcription factors. These sites enable targeted experimental validation and thus further delineation of the Crp and PurR regulons in E. coli.CONCLUSION:Better sensitivity and specificity can be achieved through a combination of (1) using mixed alignable and non-alignable sequence data and (2) combining evidence from multiple sites within an intergenic region.}},

%Combining phylogenetic data with co-regulated genes to identify regulatory motifs
%%%%%%%


@article{Wang2003,
    abstract = {{Motivation: Discovery of regulatory motifs in unaligned DNA sequences remains a fundamental problem in computational biology. Two categories of algorithms have been developed to identify common motifs from a set of DNA sequences. The first can be called a  multiple genes, single species' approach. It proposes that a degenerate motif is embedded in some or all of the otherwise unrelated input sequences and tries to describe a consensus motif and identify its occurrences. It is often used for co-regulated genes identified through experimental approaches. The second approach can be called  single gene, multiple species'. It requires orthologous input sequences and tries to identify unusually well conserved regions by phylogenetic footprinting. Both approaches perform well, but each has some limitations. It is tempting to combine the knowledge of co-regulation among different genes and conservation among orthologous genes to improve our ability to identify motifs.  Results: Based on the Consensus algorithm previously established by our group, we introduce a new algorithm called PhyloCon (Phylogenetic Consensus) that takes into account both conservation among orthologous genes and co-regulation of genes within a species. This algorithm first aligns conserved regions of orthologous sequences into multiple sequence alignments, or profiles, then compares profiles representing non-orthologous sequences. Motifs emerge as common regions in these profiles. Here we present a novel statistic to compare profiles of DNA sequences and a greedy approach to search for common subprofiles. We demonstrate that PhyloCon performs well on both synthetic and biological data.

%Computational Approaches to Identify Promoters and cis-Regulatory Elements in Plant Genomes
%%%%%%


@article{Rombauts2003,
    abstract = {{The identification of promoters and their regulatory elements is one of the major challenges in bioinformatics and integrates comparative, structural, and functional genomics. Many different approaches have been developed to detect conserved motifs in a set of genes that are either coregulated or orthologous.  However, although recent approaches seem promising, in general, unambiguous identification of regulatory elements is not straightforward. The delineation of promoters is even harder, due to its complex nature, and in silico promoter prediction is still in its infancy. Here, we review the different approaches that have been developed for identifying promoters and their regulatory elements. We discuss the detection of cis-acting regulatory elements using  word-counting or probabilistic methods (so-called "search by  signal" methods) and the delineation of promoters by considering both sequence content and structural features ("search by content"  methods). As an example of search by content, we explored in greater detail the association of promoters with CpG islands. However, due to differences in sequence content, the parameters used to detect CpG islands in humans and other vertebrates cannot be used for plants. Therefore, a preliminary attempt  was made to define parameters that could possibly define CpG and CpNpG islands in Arabidopsis, by exploring the compositional landscape around the transcriptional start site. To this end, a data set of more than 5,000 gene sequences was built, including the promoter region, the 5'-untranslated region, and the first introns and coding exons. Preliminary analysis shows that promoter location based on the detection of potential CpG/CpNpG islands  in the Arabidopsis genome is not straightforward. Nevertheless, because the landscape of CpG/CpNpG islands differs considerably between promoters and introns on the one side and exons (whether coding or not) on the other, more sophisticated approaches can probably be developed for the successful detection of "putative" CpG and CpNpG islands in plants.}},

@article{WangHaberer2009,

In the economically highly important grass family, our knowledge of transcription factor binding sites and transcriptional networks is still very limited. With the completion of the sorghum genome and the available rice genome sequence, comparative promoter analyses now allow genome-scale detection of conserved cis-elements.RESULTS:In this study, we identified thousands of phylogenetic footprints conserved between orthologous rice and sorghum upstream regions that are supported by co-expression information derived from three different rice expression data sets. In a complementary approach, cis-motifs were discovered by their highly conserved co-occurrence in syntenic promoter pairs. Sequence conservation and matches to known plant motifs support our findings. Expression similarities of gene pairs positively correlate with the number of motifs that are shared by gene pairs and corroborate the importance of similar promoter architectures for concerted regulation. This strongly suggests that these motifs function in the regulation of transcript levels in rice and, presumably also in sorghum.CONCLUSION:Our work provides the first large-scale collection of cis-elements for rice and sorghum and can serve as a paradigm for cis-element analysis through comparative genomics in grasses in general.}},

    abstract = {{Gene regulatory pathways converge at the level of transcription, where interactions among regulatory genes and between regulators and target genes result in the establishment of spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression. The growing identification of direct target genes for key transcription factors (TFs) through traditional and high-throughput experimental approaches has facilitated the elucidation of regulatory networks at the genome level. To integrate this information into a Web-based knowledgebase, we have developed the Arabidopsis Gene Regulatory Information Server (AGRIS). AGRIS, which contains all Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) promoter sequences, TFs, and their target genes and functions, provides the scientific community with a platform to establish regulatory networks. AGRIS currently houses three linked databases: AtcisDB (Arabidopsis thaliana cis-regulatory database), AtTFDB (Arabidopsis thaliana transcription factor database), and AtRegNet (Arabidopsis thaliana regulatory network). AtTFDB contains 1,690 Arabidopsis TFs and their sequences (protein and DNA) grouped into 50 (October 2005) families with information on available mutants in the corresponding genes. AtcisDB consists of 25,806 (September 2005) promoter sequences of annotated Arabidopsis genes with a description of putative cis-regulatory elements. AtRegNet links, in direct interactions, several hundred genes with the TFs that control their expression. The current release of AtRegNet contains a total of 187 (September 2005) direct targets for 66 TFs. AGRIS can be accessed at http://Arabidopsis.med.ohio-state.edu.}},

Each sequence must contain at least one common site. No alignment of the sites is required. Instead, the uncertainty in the location of the sites is handled by employing the missing information principle to develop an ?expectation maximization? (EM) algorithm. This approach allows for the simultaneous identification of the sites and characterization of the binding motifs. The reliability of the algorithm increases with the number of fragments, but the computations increase only linearly. The method is illustrated with an example, using known cyclic adenosine monophophate receptor protein (CRP) binding sites.

%Limitations and potentials of current motif discovery algorithms

@article{Hu2005,
    abstract = {{Computational methods for de novo identification of gene regulation elements, such as transcription factor binding sites, have proved to be useful for deciphering genetic regulatory networks. However, despite the availability of a large number of algorithms, their strengths and weaknesses are not sufficiently understood. Here, we designed a comprehensive set of performance measures and benchmarked five modern sequence-based motif discovery algorithms using large datasets generated from Escherichia coli RegulonDB. Factors that affect the prediction accuracy, scalability and reliability are characterized. It is revealed that the nucleotide and the binding site level accuracy are very low, while the motif level accuracy is relatively high, which indicates that the algorithms can usually capture at least one correct motif in an input sequence. To exploit diverse predictions from multiple runs of one or more algorithms, a consensus ensemble algorithm has been developed, which achieved 6–45\% improvement over the base algorithms by increasing both the sensitivity and specificity. Our study illustrates limitations and potentials of existing sequence-based motif discovery algorithms. Taking advantage of the revealed potentials, several promising directions for further improvements are discussed. Since the sequence-based algorithms are the baseline of most of the modern motif discovery algorithms, this paper suggests substantial improvements would be possible for them.}},

%An algorithm for finding protein-DNA binding sites with applications to chromatin-immunoprecipitation microarray experiments.

@article{LiuBrutlag2002,
    abstract = {{Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by cDNA microarray hybridization (ChIP-array) has become a popular procedure for studying genome-wide protein-DNA interactions and transcription regulation. However, it can only map the probable protein-DNA interaction loci within 1-2 kilobases resolution. To pinpoint interaction sites down to the base-pair level, we introduce a computational method, Motif Discovery scan (MDscan), that examines the ChIP-array-selected sequences and searches for DNA sequence motifs representing the protein-DNA interaction sites. MDscan combines the advantages of two widely adopted motif search strategies, word enumeration and position-specific weight matrix updating, and incorporates the ChIP-array ranking information to accelerate searches and enhance their success rates. MDscan correctly identified all the experimentally verified motifs from published ChIP-array experiments in yeast (STE12, GAL4, RAP1, SCB, MCB, MCM1, SFF, and SWI5), and predicted two motif patterns for the differential binding of Rap1 protein in telomere regions. In our studies, the method was faster and more accurate than several established motif-finding algorithms. MDscan can be used to find DNA motifs not only in ChIP-array experiments but also in other experiments in which a subgroup of the sequences can be inferred to contain relatively abundant motif sites. The MDscan web server can be accessed at http://BioProspector.stanford.edu/MDscan/.}},

BioProspector, a C program using a Gibbs sampling strategy, examines the upstream region of genes in the same gene expression pattern group and looks for regulatory sequence motifs. BioProspector uses zero to third-order Markov background models whose parameters are either given by the user or estimated from a specified sequence file. The significance of each motif found is judged based on a motif score distribution estimated by a Monte Carlo method. In addition, BioProspector modifies the motif model used in the earlier Gibbs samplers to allow for the modeling of gapped motifs and motifs with palindromic patterns. All these modifications greatly improve the performance of the program. Although testing and development are still in progress, the program has shown preliminary success in finding the binding motifs for Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAP1, Bacillus subtilis RNA polymerase, and Escherichia coli CRP.

    abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:Integrating data from multiple global assays and curated databases is essential to understand the spatio-temporal interactions within cells. Different experiments measure cellular processes at various widths and depths, while databases contain biological information based on established facts or published data. Integrating these complementary datasets helps infer a mutually consistent transcriptional regulatory network ({TRN}) with strong similarity to the structure of the underlying genetic regulatory modules. Decomposing the {TRN} into a small set of recurring regulatory patterns, called network motifs ({NM}), facilitates the inference. Identifying {NMs} defined by specific transcription factors ({TF}) establishes the framework structure of a {TRN} and allows the inference of {TF}-target gene relationship. This paper introduces a computational framework for utilizing data from multiple sources to infer {TF}-target gene relationships on the basis of {NMs}. The data include time course gene expression profiles, genome-wide location analysis data, binding sequence data, and gene ontology ({GO}) {information.RESULTS}:The proposed computational framework was tested using gene expression data associated with cell cycle progression in yeast. Among 800 cell cycle related genes, 85 were identified as candidate {TFs} and classified into four previously defined {NMs}. The {NMs} for a subset of {TFs} are obtained from literature. Support vector machine ({SVM}) classifiers were used to estimate {NMs} for the remaining {TFs}. The potential downstream target genes for the {TFs} were clustered into 34 biologically significant groups. The relationships between {TFs} and potential target gene clusters were examined by training recurrent neural networks whose topologies mimic the {NMs} to which the {TFs} are classified. The identified relationships between {TFs} and gene clusters were evaluated using the following biological validation and statistical analyses: (1) Gene set enrichment analysis ({GSEA}) to evaluate the clustering results; (2) Leave-one-out cross-validation ({LOOCV}) to ensure that the {SVM} classifiers assign {TFs} to {NM} categories with high confidence; (3) Binding site enrichment analysis ({BSEA}) to determine enrichment of the gene clusters for the cognate binding sites of their predicted {TFs}; (4) Comparison with previously reported results in the literatures to confirm the inferred {regulations.CONCLUSION}:The major contribution of this study is the development of a computational framework to assist the inference of {TRN} by integrating heterogeneous data from multiple sources and by decomposing a {TRN} into {NM}-based modules. The inference capability of the proposed framework is verified statistically (e.g., {LOOCV}) and biologically (e.g., {GSEA}, {BSEA}, and literature validation). The proposed framework is useful for inferring small {NM}-based modules of {TF}-target gene relationships that can serve as a basis for generating new testable hypotheses.},

%Pol {II} promoter prediction using characteristic 4-mer motifs: a machine learning approach
%%%


@article{Anwar2008,
    abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:Eukaryotic promoter prediction using computational analysis techniques is one of the most difficult jobs in computational genomics that is essential for constructing and understanding genetic regulatory networks. The increased availability of sequence data for various eukaryotic organisms in recent years has necessitated for better tools and techniques for the prediction and analysis of promoters in eukaryotic sequences. Many promoter prediction methods and tools have been developed to date but they have yet to provide acceptable predictive performance. One obvious criteria to improve on current methods is to devise a better system for selecting appropriate features of promoters that distinguish them from non-promoters. Secondly improved performance can be achieved by enhancing the predictive ability of the machine learning algorithms {used.RESULTS}:In this paper, a novel approach is presented in which 128 4-mer motifs in conjunction with a non-linear machine-learning algorithm utilising a Support Vector Machine ({SVM}) are used to distinguish between promoter and non-promoter {DNA} sequences. By applying this approach to plant, Drosophila, human, mouse and rat sequences, the classification model has showed 7-fold cross-validation percentage accuracies of 83.81\%, 94.82\%, 91.25\%, 90.77\% and 82.35\% respectively. The high sensitivity and specificity value of 0.86 and 0.90 for plant; 0.96 and 0.92 for Drosophila; 0.88 and 0.92 for human; 0.78 and 0.84 for mouse and 0.82 and 0.80 for rat demonstrate that this technique is less prone to false positive results and exhibits better performance than many other tools. Moreover, this model successfully identifies location of promoter using {TATA} weight {matrix.CONCLUSION}:The high sensitivity and specificity indicate that 4-mer frequencies in conjunction with supervised machine-learning methods can be beneficial in the identification of {RNA} pol {II} promoters comparative to other methods. This approach can be extended to identify promoters in sequences for other eukaryotic genomes.},

%Characterization of the \&lt;i\&gt;TaAIDFa\&lt;/i\&gt; gene encoding a CRT/DRE-binding factor responsive to drought, high-salt, and cold stress in wheat
%%%


@article{Xu2008,
    abstract = {{Dehydration responsive element-binding factors (DBFs) belong to the AP2/ERF superfamily and play vital regulatory roles in abiotic stress responses in plants. In this study, we isolated three novel homologs of the DBF gene family in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) by screening a drought-induced cDNA library and designated them as TaAIDFs (T. aestivum abiotic stress-induced DBFs). Compared to TaAIDFb and TaAIDFc, TaAIDFa lacks a short Ser/Thr-rich region, a putative phosphorylation site, following the AP2/ERF domain. The TaAIDFa gene, located on chromosome 3BS, is interrupted by a single intron at the 17th Arg (R) in the N-terminal domain. The N-terminal region of the TaAIDFa protein modulates nuclear localization. The TaAIDFa protein is capable of binding to CRT/DRE elements in vitro and in vivo, and of trans-activating reporter gene expression in yeast cells. The TaAIDFa promoter, with various stress-related cis-acting elements, drives expression of the GUS reporter gene in wheat calli under stress conditions. This was further confirmed by responses of TaAIDFa transcripts to drought, salinity, low-temperature, and exogenous ABA. Furthermore, overexpression of TaAIDFa activated CRT/DRE-containing genes under normal growth conditions, and improved drought and osmotic stress tolerances in transgenic Arabidopsis plants.

    abstract = {Identification of downstream target genes of stress-relating transcription factors ({TFs}) is desirable in understanding cellular responses to various environmental stimuli. However, this has long been a difficult work for both experimental and computational practices. In this research, we presented a novel computational strategy which combined the analysis of the transcription factor binding site ({TFBS}) contexts and machine learning approach. Using this strategy, we conducted a genome-wide investigation into novel direct target genes of dehydration responsive element binding proteins ({DREBs}), the members of {AP2}-{EREBPs} transcription factor super family which is reported to be responsive to various abiotic stresses in Arabidopsis. The genome-wide searching yielded in total 474 target gene candidates. With reference to the microarray data for abiotic stresses-inducible gene expression profile, 268 target gene candidates out of the total 474 genes predicted, were induced during the 24-h exposure to abiotic stresses. This takes about 57\% of total predicted targets. Furthermore, {GO} annotations revealed that these target genes are likely involved in protein amino acid phosphorylation, protein binding and Endomembrane sorting system. The results suggested that the predicted target gene candidates were adequate to meet the essential biological principle of stress-resistance in plants.},

@article{Schultheiss2009,

An important problem is the identification of transcription factor ({TF}) binding sites in promoter regions of potential {TF} target genes. It is typically approached by position weight matrix-based motif identification algorithms using Gibbs sampling, or heuristics to extend seed oligos. Such algorithms succeed in identifying single, relatively well-conserved binding sites, but tend to fail when it comes to the identification of combinations of several degenerate binding sites, as those often found in cis-regulatory {modules.Results}: We propose a new algorithm that combines the benefits of existing motif finding with the ones of support vector machines ({SVMs}) to find degenerate motifs in order to improve the modeling of regulatory modules.

%Research on plant abiotic stress responses in the post-genome era: past, present and future

@article{Hirayama2010,
    abstract = {{Understanding abiotic stress responses in plants is an important and challenging topic in plant research. Physiological and molecular biological analyses have allowed us to draw a picture of abiotic stress responses in various plants, and determination of the Arabidopsis genome sequence has had a great impact on this research field. The availability of the complete genome sequence has facilitated access to essential information for all genes, e.g. gene products and their function, transcript levels, putative cis-regulatory elements, and alternative splicing patterns. These data have been obtained from comprehensive transcriptome analyses and studies using full-length cDNA collections and T-DNA- or transposon-tagged mutant lines, which were also enhanced by genome sequence information. Moreover, studies on novel regulatory mechanisms involving use of small RNA molecules, chromatin modulation and genomic DNA modification have enabled us to recognize that plants have evolved complicated and sophisticated systems in response to complex abiotic stresses. Integrated data obtained with various 'omics' approaches have provided a more comprehensive picture of abiotic stress responses. In addition, research on stress responses in various plant species other than Arabidopsis has increased our knowledge regarding the mechanisms of plant stress tolerance in nature. Based on this progress, improvements in crop stress tolerance have been attempted by means of gene transfer and marker-assisted breeding. In this review, we summarize recent progress in abiotic stress studies, especially in the post-genomic era, and offer new perspectives on research directions for the next decade.}},

The reconstruction of a network is modeled as a binary classification problem for each pair of genes. A statistical classifier is trained to recognize the relationships between the activation profiles of gene pairs. This approach has been proven to outperform previous unsupervised methods. However, the supervised approach raises open questions. In particular, although known regulatory connections can safely be assumed to be positive training examples, obtaining negative examples is not straightforward, because definite knowledge is typically not available that a given pair of genes do not {interact.RESULTS}:A recent advance in research on data mining is a method capable of learning a classifier from only positive and unlabeled examples, that does not need labeled negative examples. Applied to the reconstruction of gene regulatory networks, we show that this method significantly outperforms the current state of the art of machine learning methods. We assess the new method using both simulated and experimental data, and obtain major performance {improvement.CONCLUSIONS}:Compared to unsupervised methods for gene network inference, supervised methods are potentially more accurate, but for training they need a complete set of known regulatory connections. A supervised method that can be trained using only positive and unlabeled data, as presented in this paper, is especially beneficial for the task of inferring gene regulatory networks, because only an incomplete set of known regulatory connections is available in public databases such as {RegulonDB}, {TRRD}, {KEGG}, Transfac, and {IPA}.},

In this paper we investigate the issues that arise when searching for promoters in other species using an ensemble of {SVM} classifiers trained on E. coli promoters. {DNA} sequences are represented using a tagged mismatch string kernel. The major benefit of our approach is that it does not require a prior definition of the typical −35 and −10 hexamers. This gives the {SVM} classifiers the freedom to discover other features relevant to the prediction of promoters. We use our approach to predict σ A promoters in B. subtilis and σ 66 promoters in Chlamydia trachomatis . We extended the analysis to identify specific regulatory features of gene sets in C. trachomatis having different expression profiles. We found a strong −35 hexamer and {TGN}/−10 associated with a set of early expressed genes.

%Kernel based methods for accelerated failure time model with ultra-high dimensional data

@article{Liu2010,
    abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:Most genomic data have ultra-high dimensions with more than 10,000 genes (probes). Regularization methods with L1 and Lp penalty have been extensively studied in survival analysis with high-dimensional genomic data. However, when the sample size n << m (the number of genes), directly identifying a small subset of genes from ultra-high (m > 10, 000) dimensional data is time-consuming and not computationally efficient. In current microarray analysis, what people really do is select a couple of thousands (or hundreds) of genes using univariate analysis or statistical tests, and then apply the {LASSO}-type penalty to further reduce the number of disease associated genes. This two-step procedure may introduce bias and inaccuracy and lead us to miss biologically important {genes.RESULTS}:The accelerated failure time ({AFT}) model is a linear regression model and a useful alternative to the Cox model for survival analysis. In this paper, we propose a nonlinear kernel based {AFT} model and an efficient variable selection method with adaptive kernel ridge regression. Our proposed variable selection method is based on the kernel matrix and dual problem with a much smaller n x n matrix. It is very efficient when the number of unknown variables (genes) is much larger than the number of samples. Moreover, the primal variables are explicitly updated and the sparsity in the solution is {exploited.CONCLUSIONS}:Our proposed methods can simultaneously identify survival associated prognostic factors and predict survival outcomes with ultra-high dimensional genomic data. We have demonstrated the performance of our methods with both simulation and real data. The proposed method performs superbly with limited computational studies.},

Performances of the proposed methods are compared with the existing {SVM}-based criteria, Logistic Regression Analysis ({LRA}), Logic Regression ({LR}), and Decision Tree ({DT}) methods by using both two real {TF} target genes data and the simulated data. In terms of test error rates, the proposed methods perform better than the existing methods.},

In addition, we try to assess the possibility of improving such results by heterogeneous data fusion and by estimating a probability of a correct classification. As shown in other studies, we have found that transcription co-expression is a good estimator for genetic co-regulation. We also have found some evidence that operator site sequence motifs can be used to estimate co-regulation, but the kernels used for feature extraction did not achieve classification rates comparable to expression data.

Plants have acquired various stress tolerance mechanisms, which are different processes involving physiological and biochemical changes that result in adaptive or morphological changes.

Genetic regulation and epigenetic regulation, including changes in nucleosome distribution, histone modification, DNA methylation, and npcRNAs (non-protein-coding RNA) play important roles in abiotic stress gene networks. Transcriptomics, metabolomics, bioinformatics, and high-through-put DNA sequencing have enabled active analyses of regulatory networks that control abiotic stress responses.

% A survey of DNA motif finding algorithms
%%%%%%%%%%%
@article{Das2007,
    abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Unraveling the mechanisms that regulate gene expression is a major challenge in biology. An important task in this challenge is to identify regulatory elements, especially the binding sites in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) for transcription factors. These binding sites are short DNA segments that are called motifs. Recent advances in genome sequence availability and in high-throughput gene expression analysis technologies have allowed for the development of computational methods for motif finding. As a result, a large number of motif finding algorithms have been implemented and applied to various motif models over the past decade. This survey reviews the latest developments in DNA motif finding algorithms.RESULTS:Earlier algorithms use promoter sequences of coregulated genes from single genome and search for statistically overrepresented motifs. Recent algorithms are designed to use phylogenetic footprinting or orthologous sequences and also an integrated approach where promoter sequences of coregulated genes and phylogenetic footprinting are used. All the algorithms studied have been reported to correctly detect the motifs that have been previously detected by laboratory experimental approaches, and some algorithms were able to find novel motifs. However, most of these motif finding algorithms have been shown to work successfully in yeast and other lower organisms, but perform significantly worse in higher organisms.CONCLUSION:Despite considerable efforts to date, DNA motif finding remains a complex challenge for biologists and computer scientists. Researchers have taken many different approaches in developing motif discovery tools and the progress made in this area of research is very encouraging. Performance comparison of different motif finding tools and identification of the best tools have proven to be a difficult task because tools are designed based on algorithms and motif models that are diverse and complex and our incomplete understanding of the biology of regulatory mechanism does not always provide adequate evaluation of underlying algorithms over motif models.}},

%Extracting regulatory sites from the upstream region of yeast genes by computational analysis of oligonucleotide frequencies1

@article{Helden1998,

Although conceptually simple, the algorithm proved efficient for extracting, from most of the yeast regulatory families analyzed, the upstream regulatory sequences which had been previously found by experimental analysis. Furthermore, putative new regulatory sites are predicted within upstream regions of several regulons. The method is based on the detection of over-represented oligonucleotides. A specificity of this approach is to define the statistical significance of a site based on tables of oligonucleotide frequencies observed in all non-coding sequences from the yeast genome. In contrast with heuristic methods, this oligonucleotide analysis is rigorous and exhaustive. Its range of detection is however limited to relatively simple patterns: short motifs with a highly conserved core. These features seem to be shared by a good number of regulatory sites in yeast. This, and similar methods, should be increasingly required to identify unknown regulatory elements within the numerous new coregulated families resulting from measurements of gene expression levels at the genomic scale.

%Finding composite regulatory patterns in DNA sequences

@article{Eskin2002,
    abstract = {{Pattern discovery in unaligned DNA sequences is a fundamental problem in computational biology with important applications in finding regulatory signals. Current approaches to pattern discovery focus on monad patterns that correspond to relatively short contiguous strings. However, many of the actual regulatory signals are composite patterns that are groups of monad patterns that occur near each other. A difficulty in discovering composite patterns is that one or both of the component monad patterns in the group may be 'too weak'. Since the traditional monad-based motif finding algorithms usually output one (or a few) high scoring patterns, they often fail to find composite regulatory signals consisting of weak monad parts. In this paper, we present a MITRA (MIsmatch TRee Algorithm) approach for discovering composite signals. We demonstrate that MITRA performs well for both monad and composite patterns by presenting experiments over biological and synthetic data.}},

A mathematical definition of this "local multiple alignment" problem suitable for full computer automation has been used to develop a new and sensitive algorithm, based on the statistical method of iterative sampling. This algorithm finds an optimized local alignment model for N sequences in N-linear time, requiring only seconds on current workstations, and allows the simultaneous detection and optimization of multiple patterns and pattern repeats.

%A Gibbs Sampling Method to Detect Overrepresented Motifs in the Upstream Regions of Coexpressed Genes

@article{Thijs2002,
    abstract = {{Microarray experiments can reveal important information about transcriptional regulation. In our case, we look for potential promoter regulatory elements in the upstream region of coexpressed genes. Here we present two modifications of the original Gibbs sampling algorithm for motif finding (Lawrence et al., 1993). First, we introduce the use of a probability distribution to estimate the number of copies of the motif in a sequence. Second, we describe the technical aspects of the incorporation of a higher-order background model whose application we discussed in Thijs et al. (2001). Our implementation is referred to as the Motif Sampler. We successfully validate our algorithm on several data sets. First, we show results for three sets of upstream sequences containing known motifs: 1) the G-box light-response element in plants, 2) elements involved in methionine response in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and 3) the FNR O(2)-responsive element in bacteria. We use these data sets to explain the influence of the parameters on the performance of our algorithm. Second, we show results for upstream sequences from four clusters of coexpressed genes identified in a microarray experiment on wounding in Arabidopsis thaliana. Several motifs could be matched to regulatory elements from plant defence pathways in our database of plant cis-acting regulatory elements (PlantCARE). Some other strong motifs do not have corresponding motifs in PlantCARE but are promising candidates for further analysis.}},

%Identifying the conserved network of cis-regulatory sites of a eukaryotic genome

@article{Wang2005,
    abstract = {{A major focus of genome research has been to decipher the cis-regulatory code that governs complex transcriptional regulation. We report a computational approach for identifying conserved regulatory motifs of an organism directly from whole genome sequences of several related species without reliance on additional information. We first construct phylogenetic profiles for each promoter, then use a blast-like algorithm to efficiently search through the entire profile space of all of the promoters in the genome to identify conserved motifs and the promoters that contain them. Statistical significance is estimated by modified Karlin–Altschul statistics. We applied this approach to the analysis of 3,524 Saccharomyces cerevisiae promoters and identified a highly organized regulatory network involving 3,315 promoters and 296 motifs. This network includes nearly all of the currently known motifs and covers >90\% of known transcription factor binding sites. Most of the predicted coregulated gene clusters in the network have additional supporting evidence. Theoretical analysis suggests that our algorithm should be applicable to much larger genomes, such as the human genome, without reaching its statistical limitation.}},

%PhyloScan: identification of transcription factor binding sites using cross-species evidence

@article{Carmack2007,
    abstract = {{BACKGROUND:When transcription factor binding sites are known for a particular transcription factor, it is possible to construct a motif model that can be used to scan sequences for additional sites. However, few statistically significant sites are revealed when a transcription factor binding site motif model is used to scan a genome-scale database.METHODS:We have developed a scanning algorithm, PhyloScan, which combines evidence from matching sites found in orthologous data from several related species with evidence from multiple sites within an intergenic region, to better detect regulons. The orthologous sequence data may be multiply aligned, unaligned, or a combination of aligned and unaligned. In aligned data, PhyloScan statistically accounts for the phylogenetic dependence of the species contributing data to the alignment and, in unaligned data, the evidence for sites is combined assuming phylogenetic independence of the species. The statistical significance of the gene predictions is calculated directly, without employing training sets.RESULTS:In a test of our methodology on synthetic data modeled on seven Enterobacteriales, four Vibrionales, and three Pasteurellales species, PhyloScan produces better sensitivity and specificity than MONKEY, an advanced scanning approach that also searches a genome for transcription factor binding sites using phylogenetic information. The application of the algorithm to real sequence data from seven Enterobacteriales species identifies novel Crp and PurR transcription factor binding sites, thus providing several new potential sites for these transcription factors. These sites enable targeted experimental validation and thus further delineation of the Crp and PurR regulons in E. coli.CONCLUSION:Better sensitivity and specificity can be achieved through a combination of (1) using mixed alignable and non-alignable sequence data and (2) combining evidence from multiple sites within an intergenic region.}},

%Combining phylogenetic data with co-regulated genes to identify regulatory motifs
%%%%%%%


@article{Wang2003,
    abstract = {{Motivation: Discovery of regulatory motifs in unaligned DNA sequences remains a fundamental problem in computational biology. Two categories of algorithms have been developed to identify common motifs from a set of DNA sequences. The first can be called a  multiple genes, single species' approach. It proposes that a degenerate motif is embedded in some or all of the otherwise unrelated input sequences and tries to describe a consensus motif and identify its occurrences. It is often used for co-regulated genes identified through experimental approaches. The second approach can be called  single gene, multiple species'. It requires orthologous input sequences and tries to identify unusually well conserved regions by phylogenetic footprinting. Both approaches perform well, but each has some limitations. It is tempting to combine the knowledge of co-regulation among different genes and conservation among orthologous genes to improve our ability to identify motifs.  Results: Based on the Consensus algorithm previously established by our group, we introduce a new algorithm called PhyloCon (Phylogenetic Consensus) that takes into account both conservation among orthologous genes and co-regulation of genes within a species. This algorithm first aligns conserved regions of orthologous sequences into multiple sequence alignments, or profiles, then compares profiles representing non-orthologous sequences. Motifs emerge as common regions in these profiles. Here we present a novel statistic to compare profiles of DNA sequences and a greedy approach to search for common subprofiles. We demonstrate that PhyloCon performs well on both synthetic and biological data.

%Computational Approaches to Identify Promoters and cis-Regulatory Elements in Plant Genomes
%%%%%%


@article{Rombauts2003,
    abstract = {{The identification of promoters and their regulatory elements is one of the major challenges in bioinformatics and integrates comparative, structural, and functional genomics. Many different approaches have been developed to detect conserved motifs in a set of genes that are either coregulated or orthologous.  However, although recent approaches seem promising, in general, unambiguous identification of regulatory elements is not straightforward. The delineation of promoters is even harder, due to its complex nature, and in silico promoter prediction is still in its infancy. Here, we review the different approaches that have been developed for identifying promoters and their regulatory elements. We discuss the detection of cis-acting regulatory elements using  word-counting or probabilistic methods (so-called "search by  signal" methods) and the delineation of promoters by considering both sequence content and structural features ("search by content"  methods). As an example of search by content, we explored in greater detail the association of promoters with CpG islands. However, due to differences in sequence content, the parameters used to detect CpG islands in humans and other vertebrates cannot be used for plants. Therefore, a preliminary attempt  was made to define parameters that could possibly define CpG and CpNpG islands in Arabidopsis, by exploring the compositional landscape around the transcriptional start site. To this end, a data set of more than 5,000 gene sequences was built, including the promoter region, the 5'-untranslated region, and the first introns and coding exons. Preliminary analysis shows that promoter location based on the detection of potential CpG/CpNpG islands  in the Arabidopsis genome is not straightforward. Nevertheless, because the landscape of CpG/CpNpG islands differs considerably between promoters and introns on the one side and exons (whether coding or not) on the other, more sophisticated approaches can probably be developed for the successful detection of "putative" CpG and CpNpG islands in plants.}},
