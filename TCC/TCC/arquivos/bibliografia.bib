@article{Chen2007GmDREB2,
    abstract = {{A novel DREB (dehydration responsive element binding protein) homologous gene, GmDREB2, was isolated from soybean. Based on its similarity with AP2 domains, GmDREB2 was classified into A-5 subgroup in DREB subfamily in AP2/EREBP family. Expression of GmDREB2 gene was induced by drought, high salt, and low temperature stresses and abscisic acid treatment. The GmDREB2 bound specifically to DRE element in vitro. Furthermore, the overexpression of GmDREB2 activated expression of downstream genes in transgenic Arabidopsis, resulting in enhanced tolerance to drought and high-salt stresses and did not cause growth retardation. Analysis of free proline contents in transgenic tobacco indicated that the overexpression of GmDREB2 accumulated higher level of free proline compared to the wild type plants under drought condition. The results from this study indicate that this novel soybean GmDREB2 gene functions as an important transcriptional activator and may be useful in improving of plant tolerance to abiotic stresses in plants.}},

%Role of DREB transcription factors in abiotic and biotic stress tolerance in plants
%%%%%%%%%

@article{Agarwal2006,
    abstract = {{Abiotic and biotic stresses negatively influence survival, biomass production and crop yield. Being multigenic as well as a quantitative trait, it is a challenge to understand the molecular basis of abiotic stress tolerance and to manipulate it as compared to biotic stresses. Lately, some transcription factor(s) that regulate the expression of several genes related to stress have been discovered. One such class of the transcription factors is DREB/CBF that binds to drought responsive cis-acting elements. DREBs belong to ERF family of transcription factors consisting of two subclasses, i.e. DREB1/CBF and DREB2 that are induced by cold and dehydration, respectively. The DREBs are apparently involved in biotic stress signaling pathway. It has been possible to engineer stress tolerance in transgenic plants by manipulating the expression of DREBs. This opens an excellent opportunity to develop stress tolerant crops in future. This review intends to focus on the structure, role of DREBs in plant stress signaling and the present status of their deployment in developing stress tolerant transgenic plants.}},

Kernel machines provide a modular framework that can be adapted to different tasks and domains by the choice of the kernel function and the base algorithm. They are replacing neural networks in a variety of fields, including engineering, information retrieval, and bioinformatics.<br /> <br /> <i>Learning with Kernels</i> provides an introduction to SVMs and related kernel methods. Although the book begins with the basics, it also includes the latest research. It provides all of the concepts necessary to enable a reader equipped with some basic mathematical knowledge to enter the world of machine learning using theoretically well-founded yet easy-to-use kernel algorithms and to understand and apply the powerful algorithms that have been developed over the last few years.}},

%Classifying transcription factor targets and discovering relevant biological features
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
@article{Holloway2008,
    abstract = {{BACKGROUND:An important goal in post-genomic research is discovering the network of interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and the genes they regulate. We have previously reported the development of a supervised-learning approach to TF target identification, and used it to predict targets of 104 transcription factors in yeast. We now include a new sequence conservation measure, expand our predictions to include 59 new TFs, introduce a web-server, and implement an improved ranking method to reveal the biological features contributing to regulation. The classifiers combine 8 genomic datasets covering a broad range of measurements including sequence conservation, sequence overrepresentation, gene expression, and DNA structural properties.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:(1) Application of the method yields an amplification of information about yeast regulators. The ratio of total targets to previously known targets is greater than 2 for 11 TFs, with several having larger gains: Ash1(4), Ino2(2.6), Yaf1(2.4), and Yap6(2.4).(2) Many predicted targets for TFs match well with the known biology of their regulators. As a case study we discuss the regulator Swi6, presenting evidence that it may be important in the DNA damage response, and that the previously uncharacterized gene YMR279C plays a role in DNA damage response and perhaps in cell-cycle progression.(3) A procedure based on recursive-feature-elimination is able to uncover from the large initial data sets those features that best distinguish targets for any TF, providing clues relevant to its biology. An analysis of Swi6 suggests a possible role in lipid metabolism, and more specifically in metabolism of ceramide, a bioactive lipid currently being investigated for anti-cancer properties.(4) An analysis of global network properties highlights the transcriptional network hubs; the factors which control the most genes and the genes which are bound by the largest set of regulators. Cell-cycle and growth related regulators dominate the former; genes involved in carbon metabolism and energy generation dominate the latter.CONCLUSION:Postprocessing of regulatory-classifier results can provide high quality predictions, and feature ranking strategies can deliver insight into the regulatory functions of TFs. Predictions are available at an online web-server, including the full transcriptional network, which can be analyzed using VisAnt network analysis suite.REVIEWERS:This article was reviewed by Igor Jouline, Todd Mockler(nominated by Valerian Dolja), and Sandor Pongor.}},

%An in silico strategy identiÔ¨Åed the target gene candidates regulated by dehydration responsive element binding proteins (DREBs)in Arabidopsis genome
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

@article{Wang2009,
    abstract = {Identification of downstream target genes of stress-relating transcription factors ({TFs}) is desirable in understanding cellular responses to various environmental stimuli. However, this has long been a difficult work for both experimental and computational practices. In this research, we presented a novel computational strategy which combined the analysis of the transcription factor binding site ({TFBS}) contexts and machine learning approach. Using this strategy, we conducted a genome-wide investigation into novel direct target genes of dehydration responsive element binding proteins ({DREBs}), the members of {AP2}-{EREBPs} transcription factor super family which is reported to be responsive to various abiotic stresses in Arabidopsis. The genome-wide searching yielded in total 474 target gene candidates. With reference to the microarray data for abiotic stresses-inducible gene expression profile, 268 target gene candidates out of the total 474 genes predicted, were induced during the 24-h exposure to abiotic stresses. This takes about 57\% of total predicted targets. Furthermore, {GO} annotations revealed that these target genes are likely involved in protein amino acid phosphorylation, protein binding and Endomembrane sorting system. The results suggested that the predicted target gene candidates were adequate to meet the essential biological principle of stress-resistance in plants.},

%Using hexamers to predict cis-regulatory motifs in Drosophila
%%%%%%%%%

@article{Chan2005,
    abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:Cis-regulatory modules ({CRMs}) are short stretches of {DNA} that help regulate gene expression in higher eukaryotes. They have been found up to 1 megabase away from the genes they regulate and can be located upstream, downstream, and even within their target genes. Due to the difficulty of finding {CRMs} using biological and computational techniques, even well-studied regulatory systems may contain {CRMs} that have not yet been {discovered.RESULTS}:We present a simple, efficient method ({HexDiff}) based only on hexamer frequencies of known {CRMs} and {non-CRM} sequence to predict novel {CRMs} in regulatory systems. On a data set of 16 gap and pair-rule genes containing 52 known {CRMs}, predictions made by {HexDiff} had a higher correlation with the known {CRMs} than several existing {CRM} prediction algorithms: Ahab, Cluster Buster, {MSCAN}, {MCAST}, and {LWF}. After combining the results of the different algorithms, 10 putative {CRMs} were identified and are strong candidates for future study. The hexamers used by {HexDiff} to distinguish between {CRMs} and {non-CRM} sequence were also analyzed and were shown to be enriched in regulatory {elements.CONCLUSION}:{HexDiff} provides an efficient and effective means for finding new {CRMs} based on known {CRMs}, rather than known binding sites.},

%Combining classifiers to predict gene function in Arabidopsis thaliana using large-scale gene expression measurements
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
@article{Lan2007,
    abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Arabidopsis thaliana is the model species of current plant genomic research with a genome size of 125 Mb and approximately 28,000 genes. The function of half of these genes is currently unknown. The purpose of this study is to infer gene function in Arabidopsis using machine-learning algorithms applied to large-scale gene expression data sets, with the goal of identifying genes that are potentially involved in plant response to abiotic stress.RESULTS:Using in house and publicly available data, we assembled a large set of gene expression measurements for A. thaliana. Using those genes of known function, we first evaluated and compared the ability of basic machine-learning algorithms to predict which genes respond to stress. Predictive accuracy was measured using ROC50 and precision curves derived through cross validation. To improve accuracy, we developed a method for combining these classifiers using a weighted-voting scheme. The combined classifier was then trained on genes of known function and applied to genes of unknown function, identifying genes that potentially respond to stress. Visual evidence corroborating the predictions was obtained using electronic Northern analysis. Three of the predicted genes were chosen for biological validation. Gene knockout experiments confirmed that all three are involved in a variety of stress responses. The biological analysis of one of these genes (At1g16850) is presented here, where it is shown to be necessary for the normal response to temperature and NaCl.CONCLUSION:Supervised learning methods applied to large-scale gene expression measurements can be used to predict gene function. However, the ability of basic learning methods to predict stress response varies widely and depends heavily on how much dimensionality reduction is used. Our method of combining classifiers can improve the accuracy of such predictions - in this case, predictions of genes involved in stress response in plants - and it effectively chooses the appropriate amount of dimensionality reduction automatically. The method provides a useful means of identifying genes in A. thaliana that potentially respond to stress, and we expect it would be useful in other organisms and for other gene functions.}},

%%The Role of Transcription Factor Binding Sites in Promoters and Their \&lt;i\&gt;In Silico\&lt;/i\&gt; Detection
%%%

@incollection{Werner2009,
    abstract = {{As detailed in this chapter TFBSs are among the most important elements of transcription control in promoters, enhancers, locus control regions, and Scaffold/Matrix Attachment regions, to name only the best known. So far, the best way to identify TFBSs in genomic sequences is by sequence similarity searches with whatever method is suitable for the task. As detailed, nucleotide weight matrices are the most popular and developed tools for this purpose. However, all of these methods locate TFBSs one by one and independent of each other, yielding what is called physical binding sites. The only answer such results can provide is the physical binding probabilities of a whole group of different TFs. Neither specific binding of a particular TF can be deduced from such data nor can any functional properties of the stretch of DNA where the TFBS was found be determined. TFBSs do not act as isolated individual binding sites but always as part of a larger context.}},

%Role of DREB transcription factors in abiotic and biotic stress tolerance in plants
%%%%%%%%%

@article{Agarwal2006,
    abstract = {{Abiotic and biotic stresses negatively influence survival, biomass production and crop yield. Being multigenic as well as a quantitative trait, it is a challenge to understand the molecular basis of abiotic stress tolerance and to manipulate it as compared to biotic stresses. Lately, some transcription factor(s) that regulate the expression of several genes related to stress have been discovered. One such class of the transcription factors is DREB/CBF that binds to drought responsive cis-acting elements. DREBs belong to ERF family of transcription factors consisting of two subclasses, i.e. DREB1/CBF and DREB2 that are induced by cold and dehydration, respectively. The DREBs are apparently involved in biotic stress signaling pathway. It has been possible to engineer stress tolerance in transgenic plants by manipulating the expression of DREBs. This opens an excellent opportunity to develop stress tolerant crops in future. This review intends to focus on the structure, role of DREBs in plant stress signaling and the present status of their deployment in developing stress tolerant transgenic plants.}},

    abstract = {{A novel DREB (dehydration responsive element binding protein) homologous gene, GmDREB2, was isolated from soybean. Based on its similarity with AP2 domains, GmDREB2 was classified into A-5 subgroup in DREB subfamily in AP2/EREBP family. Expression of GmDREB2 gene was induced by drought, high salt, and low temperature stresses and abscisic acid treatment. The GmDREB2 bound specifically to DRE element in vitro. Furthermore, the overexpression of GmDREB2 activated expression of downstream genes in transgenic Arabidopsis, resulting in enhanced tolerance to drought and high-salt stresses and did not cause growth retardation. Analysis of free proline contents in transgenic tobacco indicated that the overexpression of GmDREB2 accumulated higher level of free proline compared to the wild type plants under drought condition. The results from this study indicate that this novel soybean GmDREB2 gene functions as an important transcriptional activator and may be useful in improving of plant tolerance to abiotic stresses in plants.}},

%Cis-regulatory element based targeted gene finding: genome-wide identification of abscisic acid- and abiotic stress-responsive genes in Arabidopsis thaliana
%%%%%

@article{Zhang2005,
    abstract = {{Motivation: A fundamental problem of computational genomics is identifying the genes that respond to certain endogenous cues and environmental stimuli. This problem can be referred to as targeted gene finding. Since gene regulation is mainly determined by the binding of transcription factors and cis-regulatory DNA sequences, most existing gene annotation methods, which exploit the conservation of open reading frames, are not effective in finding targetgenes.Results: A viable approach to targeted gene finding is to exploit the cis-regulatory elements that are known to be responsible for the transcription of target genes. Given such cis-elements, putative target genes whose promoters contain the elements can be identified. As a case study, we apply the above approach to predict the genes in model plant Arabidopsis thaliana which are inducible by a phytohormone, abscisic acid (ABA), and abiotic stress, such as drought, cold and salinity. We first construct and analyze two ABA specific cis-elements, ABA-responsive element (ABRE) and its coupling element (CE), in A.thaliana, based on their conservation in rice and other cereal plants. We then use the ABRE‚ÄìCE module to identify putative ABA-responsive genes in A.thaliana. Based on RT‚ÄìPCR verification and the results from literature, this method has an accuracy rate of 67.5\% for the top 40 predictions. The cis-element based targeted gene finding approach is expected to be widely applicable since a large number of cis-elements in many species are available.Contact: zhang@cse.wustl.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data for this paper are available at Bioinformatics online.}},

It is important to develop methods that will reveal how these transcription factors act on a genome wide level, that is, through what target genes they exert their function.RESULTS:We describe here a program pipeline aimed at identifying transcription factor target genes in whole genomes. Starting from a consensus binding site, represented as a weight matrix, potential sites in a pre-filtered genome are identified and then further filtered by assessing conservation of the putative site in the genome of a related species, a process called phylogenetic footprinting. CisOrtho has been successfully used to identify targets for two homeodomain transcription factors in the genomes of the nematodes Caenorhabditis elegans and Caenorhabditis briggsae.CONCLUSIONS:CisOrtho will identify targets of other nematode transcription factors whose DNA binding specificity is known and can be easily adapted to search other genomes for transcription factor targets.}},
